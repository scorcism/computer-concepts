  <summary>### How File Names Works?</summary>
  File names are a crucial aspect of how we organize and access digital data. A file name is a string of characters that is used to identify and distinguish a specific file from other files stored on a computer or other digital device. File names typically include both a name and a file extension that indicates the type of file and helps the operating system understand how to open and interact with it.

Here are some key details about how file names work:

- Characters allowed: File names can include letters, numbers, and some special characters like underscores, hyphens, and periods. However, there are certain characters that are not allowed in file names, such as slashes, colons, and question marks, as these characters have specific meanings in file paths and can cause errors or confusion.

- File extensions: The file extension is a part of the file name that comes after the period and indicates the type of file. For example, a file with the extension ".docx" is a Microsoft Word document, while a file with the extension ".jpg" is a digital image. File extensions can be three or four characters long and are usually standardized across different operating systems and software programs.

- Length restrictions: Different operating systems have different restrictions on the length of file names. For example, on Windows, file names can be up to 260 characters long, while on macOS, they can be up to 255 characters long. In addition, there may be specific restrictions on the length of the file name and the file extension.

- Case sensitivity: Some operating systems, such as Windows, are not case-sensitive when it comes to file names, meaning that "file.txt" and "File.txt" are treated as the same file. Other operating systems, such as macOS and Linux, are case-sensitive, meaning that "file.txt" and "File.txt" are considered to be two different files.

- File path: In addition to the file name itself, the file path is an important component of how files are organized and accessed. The file path includes the name of the drive or device where the file is stored, as well as a series of directories or folders that lead to the file. For example, a file path might look like "C:\Users\UserName\Documents\File.txt", where "C:" is the name of the drive, "Users" is a top-level directory, "UserName" is a subdirectory, and "Documents" is another subdirectory that contains the file.

- Overall, file names are a critical component of how we organize and interact with digital data. Understanding how file names work can help us to create meaningful, descriptive names for our files, and ensure that they are easily accessible and searchable.
